                                                  Automated Backup System (Bash Script Project)

* A simple Bash-based backup automation system that helps you take automatic backups, verify them, and clean up old ones - all with one command.

* It’s perfect for students, developers, or DevOps learners who want to automate local backups and understand backup rotation concepts.

#  A. Project Overview
<> What Does This Script Do?

* This project automates the backup of a chosen folder by:

* Compressing the target directory into a .tar.gz archive

* Generating a SHA256 checksum to ensure file integrity

* Skipping unwanted folders like .git, node_modules, and .cache

* Automatically rotating backups (keeping only the latest 7 daily, 4 weekly, and 3 monthly backups)

* Logging every backup operation into logs/backup.log

# Why It’s Useful

Manual backups are time-consuming and prone to human error.
This automation script:

* Keeps your files safe automatically

* Saves disk space using rotation

* Provides clear logs for troubleshooting

* Can be easily customized for any system

# B. How to Use It (Step-by-Step)
# Step 1: Prerequisites

<> Make sure you have:

* Git Bash on Windows or Terminal on Linux/Mac

* tar and sha256sum utilities (installed by default on most systems)

# Step 2: Clone the Repository
* git clone https://github.com/vempatisriram6-dev/DevOps-Practice-Test.git
  
* cd backup-system

# Step 3: Configure the Backup

<> Open the file backup.config and update these paths:

* BACKUP_SOURCE="/c/Users/vempa/Desktop/test_folder"
 
* BACKUP_DESTINATION="/c/Users/vempa/Desktop/backups"
 
* LOG_FILE="./logs/backup.log"

* EXCLUDE_PATTERNS=".git,node_modules,.cache"

* DAILY_KEEP=7
* WEEKLY_KEEP=4
* MONTHLY_KEEP=3


* You can adjust retention numbers or excluded folders anytime.

# Step 4: Run the Backup
* ./backup.sh


<> This will:

* Create a new backup in your destination folder

* Save logs in logs/backup.log

* Display success/failure messages in the terminal

# Step 5: Verify the Backup

* To verify that the backup was created and matches its checksum:

* ./verify_backup.sh backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.tar.gz


<> If verification passes, you’ll see:

* [SUCCESS] Checksum verified successfully 

# Step 6: Check Logs

<> All activities (start, success, cleanup, errors) are stored here:

* logs/backup.log


# Example log:

* [INFO] Backup started at 2025-11-03 19:30:00
* [SUCCESS] Backup completed: /c/Users/vempa/Desktop/backups/backup-2025-11-03-1930.tar.gz
* [INFO] Cleanup completed 

# Step 7: Folder Structure

* backup-system/

├── backup.sh               # Main script
├── verify_backup.sh        # Backup verification script
├── backup.config           # Configuration file
├── logs/
│   └── backup.log          # Log file
├── screenshots/
│   └── backup-output.png   # Example output
└── README.md               # Documentation

# Step 8: Example Output (Screenshot)

<> Backup output shown in Git Bash:

# Step 9: Automation (Optional)

* You can automate this with Windows Task Scheduler or Linux cron jobs.

<> Example cron entry (Linux):

* 0 2 * * * /path/to/backup-system/backup.sh


*  runs the backup every day at 2 AM.

# C. How It Works:
<> Rotation Algorithm

<> The script:

* Keeps only the 7 most recent daily backups

* Keeps only the 4 most recent weekly backups

* Keeps only the 3 most recent monthly backups

* Deletes older ones automatically

* This saves disk space while ensuring recovery options.

# Checksum Creation

<> For every backup, a .sha256 file is created:

* sha256sum backup-2025-11-03-1930.tar.gz > backup-2025-11-03-1930.tar.gz.sha256


<> You can recheck integrity anytime using:

* sha256sum -c backup-2025-11-03-1930.tar.gz.sha256

# D. Design Decisions
<> Why This Approach?

* Simple and portable Bash scripting

* No dependency on third-party tools

* Ideal for beginners learning Linux + DevOps automation

# Challenges Faced:

*  Windows compatibility for Git Bash

* Managing path conversions (/c/Users/... vs C:\Users\...)

* Proper logging and simultaneous screen display

# How They Were Solved

* Used consistent POSIX-style paths

* Implemented dual logging using tee command

Added checksum validation to verify backup integrity

#  E. Testing
**  Functional Tests

# Test	Description	Result

* Backup creation	Run ./backup.sh	 Success

* Backup rotation	Created multiple backups	 Old backups removed

* Checksum verification	Using verify_backup.sh	 Passed

* Exclude patterns	.git, node_modules, .cache	 Ignored

* Error handling	Tried invalid source folder	 Graceful error

# Example Backup Log:

[INFO] Backup started at 2025-11-03 19:30:00

[SUCCESS] Backup completed: /c/Users/vempa/Desktop/backups/backup-2025-11-03-1930.tar.gz

[INFO] Rotation check complete – old backups removed

[INFO] Backup finished successfully 

 # F. Known Limitations

* Script doesn’t handle remote/cloud backups yet (local only)

* tar compression speed may be slow for very large files

* Rotation works by filename date, not by file size

* No real-time progress bar (can be added later)

# Future Improvements:

* Add remote upload support (AWS S3 / Google Drive)

* Add email notifications after each backup

* Add restore.sh to unpack backups automatically

* Integrate with cron logs or systemd timers

#  Example  Summary:

<> Command	Description:

./verify_backup.sh backup-file.tar.gz	Verify checksum

cat logs/backup.log	View logs

ls /c/Users/vempa/Desktop/backups	View all backups

./push_all.sh	(Optional) Commit + Push to GitHub
